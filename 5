Aim: Design and develop a context for given case study and implement an 
interface for Vehicles Consider the example of vehicles like bicycle, car, and bike. 
All Vehicles have common functionalities such as Gear Change, Speed up and 
apply breaks. Make an interface and put all these common functionalities. 
Bicycle, Bike, Car classes should be implemented for all these functionalities in 
their own class in their own way.


import java.io.*;
interface Vehicle {
void changeGear(int a);

void applyBrakes(int a);
}
class Bicycle implements Vehicle{
int speed;
int gear;
public void changeGear(int newGear){

}
public void speedUp(int increment){

}
public void applyBrakes(int decrement){
speed = speed - decrement;
}
public void printStates() {

}
}

public void changeGear(int newGear){

public void speedUp(int increment){

}
}

public static void main (String[] args) {
